### Review of Version 18 DQC Rules for Public Comment

**[DQC_0133 - Equity Method Investment Reporting](https://github.com/dataqualitycommittee/dqc_us_rules/blob/v18/docs/DQC_US_0133/DQC_0133.md)** - The purpose of the rule is to ensure that filers consistently report Equity Method Investment (EMI) data.  This rule has three components to help filers to ensure that they are consistent with the guidance issued by the FASB "Dimensional Modeling for Disclosures of Consolidated and Nonconsolidated Entities".

**[DQC_0134 - Investment Schedule - Financial Instrument Axis](https://github.com/dataqualitycommittee/dqc_us_rules/blob/v18/docs/DQC_US_0134/DQC_0134.md)** - The purpose of the rule is to ensure that filers report values associated with the element AvailableForSaleDebtSecuritiesAmortizedCostBasis with the correct dimensions.  The rule is intended to align filer disclosures with the guidance defined by the FASB in "Financial Instruments Debt Securities".

**[DQC_0135 - Extensible Enumerations for Financial Statement Captions](https://github.com/dataqualitycommittee/dqc_us_rules/blob/v18/docs/DQC_US_0135/DQC_0135.md)** â€“ The FASB has defined a number of elements that if reported and are not included in the face financial statements, filers need to indicate which financial statement caption the amounts appear (these elements have been identified in the US GAAP taxonomy as extensible enumeration elements). This rule has two components. The first component identifies an error if the company has made a disclosure and has not included the caption where the amount appears in the financial statements.  The second reports an error for a fact that includes the Balance Sheet and Income Statement Location axis and does not have an associated extensible enumeration using the same dimensions

**[DQC_0136 - Caption Value Matches Financial Statements](https://github.com/dataqualitycommittee/dqc_us_rules/blob/v18/docs/DQC_US_0136/DQC_0136.md)** - This rule is intended to identify those cases where the company uses an extensible list item that refers to a Balance Sheet or  Income Statement  line item that does not exist on the referenced Statement. The rule checks that the values provided for the extensible list items defined in the taxonomy are legitimate financial statement line items that appear in the presentation linkbase
